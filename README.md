# headset-switcher
Bluetooth headset switcher between a2dp_sink and headset_head_unit written on Go for linux OS with GTK.

I was inspired by this script [switchHeadphones.sh](https://gist.github.com/OndraZizka/2724d353f695dacd73a50883dfdf0fc6) and wrote Go application, which searches bluetooth headsets and can changes them mode between high quality for listening and low quality for speaking.

Also, thanks to [slytomcat](https://github.com/slytomcat) for systray libraries.

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 GNOME.
